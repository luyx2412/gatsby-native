## Gatsby Native

Build static website and app using Gatsby and React Native ⚛️

## Motivation

In my daily job, I use React Native a lot. Then, when I want to update my own portfolio website, I need to think about navigation, webpack, styling, and other things. I just want to use the same environment to code my website. 

I found this interesting plugin https://github.com/slorber/gatsby-plugin-react-native-web. I tried and it works well. But, this plugin doesn't provide support to run as React Native App. It doesn't handle navigation, packager, etc.

That's why I build this boilerplate, to make it easy getting started with Gatsby in React Native, and use the same React Native code for our static website.

## Features

- Navigation (React Navigation)
- SEO (Server Rendering)
